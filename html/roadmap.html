    Sometimes I am too lazy to update the development page about what's currently happening with frag-z, so while it might like there are no updates or things are at a stand still, it's certainly not the case, because I might feel too lazy to document the progess, instead I'll have this page which will let me show the state of progress without having to write too much:

    In the following graph diagram, the arrows represent dependencies so that the one at the start of the arrow would be required to get to the one at the tip of the arrow, blue nodes represent what is in active development
