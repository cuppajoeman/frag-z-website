    <h2>code base overview</h2>
    <p>
        first a server is started, then a client connects to it.
    </p>
    <h3>client</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            when the client is started a UI appears where you can specify the server and the port, after the player
            presses
            connect, a connection is made to the server, and the game is loaded up
        </li>
        <li>
            in the main client script we override <code>_process</code> which is a built-in godot method which runs
            evertime a frame is drawn
            <span class="todo">(todo: using the process function is bad)</span>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    we first check if we're connected to the server <span class="todo">(todo: process shouldn't be called if we're not connected?)</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    if we're not typing we call <code>input_state.update_state()</code>, here <code>input_state</code>
                    is a class which handles the input of the client and <code>update_state</code> is a method which
                    updates the keyboard/mouse inputs
                </li>
                <li>
                    next we send the keyboard/mouse state to the server through an <code>rpc</code> call, calling
                    <code>update_player_inputs_server</code> <span class="todo">(todo: Naming)</span>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        note that in godot, an rpc function must exist in the client and server at the same node, so
                        that's
                        why the client code has an instance of <code>update_player_inputs_server</code> with an empty
                        implementation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    now start reading how the server works, come back here when you're done reading it.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>server</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            when the server starts a check is made to see if it's running headless (no graphics) or not, for the
            headless
            version the server operates in the same fashion, just without a visual representation, so we'll just discuss
            the
            visual server mode for now.
        </li>
        <li>
            a ui appears where you can pick max players and a port, when you click start the server is initialized
            , a <code>Referee</code> is initialized and a most points win match is started <span class="todo">(todo: need to be able to choose
            game mode from the ui)</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            the way we're going to think of the server is like any other sports game, basketball/baseball/soccer/etc...,
            so we'll have players, each have the following:
            <ul>
                <li>players, who perform the following actions, informed by the current game mode (ex: shoot outs vs
                    normal play)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>moving</li>
                    <li>kicking/throwing a ball</li>
                    <li>interacting with other players</li>
                </ul>
                <li>rulebook, for a certain game</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>contains all rules associated with that game (ex. <a
                            href="https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/3f3e15cc1ab8977b/original/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k-pdf.pdf">fifa
                        soccer rules</a>)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>referee, someone who keeps track of the game and allocates points to different teams/players (goals,
                    red cards, fouls etc...)
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>decides whether points are valid</li>
                    <li>can give points, red cards, fouls to players and is the authority</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            so our game server will have players
            <ul>
                <li>each controlled by one client</li>
                <li>in charge of movement and shooting</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>rulebooks, for each game mode in the game <span class="todo">(todo: implement this)</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li>whether or not the game is timed</li>
            <li>whether or not the game won by reaching a certain number of points</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            a single referee (the authority over the players)
            <ul>
                <li>allocates points to players based on the current game mode's rulebook</li>
                <li>decides if the game is over based on the current game mode's rulebook</li>
                <li>other events such as map voting etc...</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            once the server is started we override the <code>_process</code> method like in the client <span
                class="todo">(todo: don't use process)</span> and inside of this method:
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>we send the player position and rotation of each player to each client</li>
            <li>we send the state of the match to each client</li>
            <li>update the server hud</li>
            <li>send messages to each client</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
