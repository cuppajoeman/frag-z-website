        <p>
            this month started off with the very first game test, with Nel, coli, Jacques, Teeare and me, the game test
            went well and fun was had.

        <ul>
            <li>death match</li>
            <p>
                On 2023-01-05 I decided that <code>Rulebook</code> isn't the right name for the class, it should just be
                <code>Match</code> since a <code>Rulebook</code> shouldn't have methods, as it's only a book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice that death match isn't actually that different from most points win, for example health can be
                considered points, and that whenever your points go below 1, then you will respawn elsewhere on the map
                with 100 points again.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    implement abstract <code>Rulebook</code>, then create <code>Rulebooks</code> for deathmatch and
                    most points win
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        in the deathmatch match, it will also contain the method <code>weapon_transaction(source_player, target_players)</code>
                    </li>
                    <ul>

                        for now deathmatch will be timed

            </ul>
            <li>new map</li>
            <p>
                in order to support the new game mode, we are going to build a new map oriented more towards death match
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>more long flat areas to fight on, not as vertical as previous map</li>
                <li>more wedges that aren't steep</li>
            </ul>
            <li>projectile launcher</li>
            <ul>
                <li>create projectile launcher class</li>
                <li>implement the physics movement function</li>
                <li>implement check to see if it's collided</li>
                <li>implement explosion</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>create a sphere at the explosion point, with <code>explosion_radius</code></li>
                    <li>
                        for each colliding thing, if it's a player, then draw a ray from the blast origin to the
                        center of the player, if it reaches that player, then we can apply a force to the player, also
                        perform a transaction (no points lost if you shoot yourself, only to other players)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                    We'll need a way to know who fired which projectile, so instead of embedding a reference
                    to an entire player, we'll just add it to a group who's name is the id of the player.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>shotgun & lightning gun</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    generalize the hitscan weapon, this generalized version has a method called <code>get_spray_pattern</code>
                    which will returns a list of hitscan rays. It will also have a method called <code>fire</code> which
                    iterates through the spray pattern and uses the referee to conduct a hitscan transaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    in order to play different sounds for the different weapons, more information needs to be added in
                    players events pertaining to firing, we also have to specify which weapon is being fired.

                <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>I've found that even running locally, it feels like aim is a little choppy.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        First I created a version of the game with everything except movement, aiming and a map stripped
                        away, next I checked the rates of the mouse polling, movement, and process function, all are
                        being clocked at 60Hz, I also checked to see if data was being trucated across the network,
                        which didn't seem to be the issue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        My conclusion is that this choppiness is chalked up to the latency introduced by the network,
                        this will be eventually remedied by using client side interpolation.
                    </li>

        <summary>december 2022 development</summary>
        <p>
            first we will develop a thin slice through the whole game, that way we will have a minimal working game that
            can
            be played.
            this way we can get user feedback as fast as possible instead of building the whole game and then having to
            undo
            previous work.
        </p>
        <p>
            the thin slice will be a version of the game where you can connect to a server online through a UI, be able
            to
            ready
            your players and then start the game, the game will be mpw with a single weapon (rail gun), rail gun beams
            will
            be
            rendered on the client side and a scoreboard will be shown. After 10 minutes the game ends and you are
            returned
            to the
            ready up state.

            <h2>review</h2>
            <p>
                this month was really good, I managed to get the game into a playable state in about a week. i built a
                map
                a system to run sound on the client, weapons, a referee system, messaging/commands and smoothed out
                movement.
            </p>
        </ul>
