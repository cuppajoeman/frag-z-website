      <p>
        first we will develop a thin slice through the whole game, that way we will have a minimal working game that can be played.
        this way we can get user feedback as fast as possible instead of building the whole game and then having to undo
        previous work.
      </p>
      <p>
        the thin slice will be a version of the game where you can connect to a server online through a UI, be able to ready
        your players and then start the game, the game will be mpw with a single weapon (rail gun), rail gun beams will be
        rendered on the client side and a scoreboard will be shown. After 10 minutes the game ends and you are returned to the
        ready up state.
